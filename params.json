{"name":"Confluence","tagline":"I have no idea what confluence means, but it sure sounds cool!","body":"### Hi\r\nI'm Ryan Przybocki, a speedcuber, mountain-biker, and student who likes math and science.\r\n\r\n### Rubik's\r\nI do the Rubik's cube!...I learned how to solve in 2007, but lost interest and didn't pick up a cube until Summer of 2013.  From then on I was hooked!\r\nCubes and methods:\r\n* 2x2: Dayan, CLL (working on EG-1).  Average about 3.2\r\n* 3x3: Zhanchi/Guhong/Aolong 2, Roux.  Average low 12's.\r\n* 4x4: Aosu, Yau.  Average 1:25\r\n* 5x5: SS, Reduction.  Average 3:00\r\n* Skewb: Moyu, Ranzha's method.  Average 4.8.\r\n* Pyraminx: SS, Keyhole (working on one-flip).  Average 6.2.\r\n* 3BLD: Guhong II, OP/M2.  Average 1:45.\r\n\r\nMy favorite events are 3x3 speedsolve, skewb, 2x2 speedsolve, and 3x3 blindfolded.  \r\n[WCA Profile](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2013PRZY02)\r\n\r\nI am active in the Texas Speedcubing community and organized a competition this past summer ([Keep Austin Weird 2014](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/c.php?i=KeepAustinWeird2014)).  I will be organizing another competition in January ([Austin Cubing Limits 2015](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/c.php?i=AustinCubingLimits2015))\r\n\r\nUnlike [Sumeet](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2011AGAR05), I actually practice.  Yet Sumeet still manages to #beatshon.\r\n\r\n### Science\r\nI like science, especially Physics.  I am also interested in engineering and plan on pursuing a career in the field.  Mechanics is the best.\r\n\r\n### No one cares about Dabuddy\r\nI have a brother named Benjamin (Dabuddy), but no one cares about him.  He is very short even though he is almost the same height as me (5'10\").  Regardless of how tall he gets, he will always be very short.\r\n\r\n### Obesity\r\nDabuddy is obese.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWant to know about my obese brother?
