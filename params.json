{"name":"Confluence","tagline":"I have no idea what confluence means, but it sure sounds cool!","body":"### Hi\r\nI'm Ryan Przybocki, a speedcuber, mountain-biker, and student who likes math and science.\r\n\r\n### Rubik's\r\nI do the Rubik's cube!...I learned how to solve in 2007, but lost interest and didn't pick up a cube until Summer of 2013.  From then on I was hooked!\r\nCubes and methods:\r\n* 2x2: Dayan, CLL (working on EG-1).  Average about 3.0\r\n* 3x3: Yuxin, Roux.  Average 10.5.\r\n* 4x4: Aosu, Yau.  Average 1:20.\r\n* 5x5: SS, Reduction.  Average 2:30.\r\n* Skewb: Moyu, Ranzha's method advanced.  Average 4.5.\r\n* Pyraminx: Moyu, Keyhole (working on advanced Keyhole).  Average 6.2.\r\n* 3BLD: modded Guhong I, OP/M2.  Average 1:20.\r\n\r\nMy favorite events are 3x3 speedsolve, skewb, 2x2 speedsolve, and 3x3 blindfolded.  \r\n[WCA Profile](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2013PRZY02)\r\n\r\nI am active in the Texas Speedcubing community and organized a competition in the summer of 2014 ([Keep Austin Weird 2014](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/c.php?i=KeepAustinWeird2014)).  I also organized another competition in January, 2015 ([Austin Cubing Limits 2015](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/c.php?i=AustinCubingLimits2015)).  I volunteer as a staff member for Texas competitions.\r\n\r\nUnlike [Sumeet](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2011AGAR05), I actually practice.  Yet Sumeet still manages to #beatshon even in 7x7x7.\r\n\r\n### Science\r\nI like science, especially Physics.  I am also interested in engineering and plan on pursuing a career in the field.  Mechanics is the best.  Albert Einstein is the man.\r\n\r\n### No one cares about Dabuddy\r\nI have a brother named Benjamin (Dabuddy), but no one cares about him.  He is very short even though he is almost the same height as me (5'10\").  Regardless of how tall he gets, he will always be very short.\r\n\r\n### Obesity\r\nDabuddy is very obese.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWant to know about my obese brother?
